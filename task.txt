1. Takes a FASTA file as input
2. Uses pipelines to calculate:
- Total number of sequences
- Total number of bases
- GC content percentage
- Longest and shortest sequence lengths
3. Outputs results in a nice format


Example usage:

./analyze_sequences.sh sample.fasta

Deliverables: 
- Your script file (analyze_sequences.sh) 
- A sample FASTA file to test it 
- Screenshot showing it works
